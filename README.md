# Introduction

Dynamic clamp devices mimic the addition (or subtraction) of transmembrane conductances in live cells during whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology experiments. This dynamic clamp set up is inspired by the [paper](http://www.eneuro.org/content/4/5/ENEURO.0250-17.2017) and [project](http://dynamicclamp.com/) of Niraj Desai, Richard Gray, and Daniel Johnston.
